# 2d-arrays-python
I've did not understand ways of creating 2d arrays in python while I was learning it, so I have recreated as simply as I could ways of interacting with arrays as known from C++.

#   usage:
#       array = Array(5,5)    -> definies array with size 5*5 equivalent of int array[5][5];
#   to modify values of array simply use:
#       array.modify(1,2,10)  -> where 1,2 stands for x,y and 10 stands for new value for array cell 
#   you can print this array with:
#       array.print()
#   you can also use:
#       array.print(1,2)      -> it increase width between array values in column and between rows
